## 🌟 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scroll-Controlled Video Playback** | Experience video playback directly linked to scroll position – scroll down to play forward, scroll up to rewind, like scrubbing through a timeline. 🎥 |
| **Smooth Scrolling with Lenis** | Enjoy fluid scrolling within a fixed container for a seamless experience. 🌀 |
| **Dynamic Header Elements** | Header components that adapt and change based on the scroll position and the current section in view. 🔄 |
| **Staggered Scroll-Linked Word Animations** | Watch characters animate in opposing directions as you scroll for a captivating text reveal effect. ✨ |
| **Scroll-Linked Image & Text Animations** | Words animate character-by-character in opposing directions as you scroll, creating a striking visual effect. Scroll-linked image reveals are paired with staggered character animations appearing in tracks below one another. 🔠 |
| **Pinned Product Details Carousel** | A product section remains pinned while scrolling through details. Carousel controls update product information, imagery, and jump the scroll position to relevant points within the pinned section. Scrolling naturally within the pinned distance also triggers these updates (debounced for performance). 👟📊 |
| **Pinned Image Animation Timeline** | Another pinned section where scroll progress reveals images and triggers staggered word animations sequentially. 🖼️⏳ |
| **Horizontal Draggable Carousel** | Interact with a horizontally draggable carousel featuring image movement linked to mouse intensity, friction-like effects, and navigation dots for image transitions. 👉👈 |
